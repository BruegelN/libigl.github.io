# Python wrappers for libigl

A [new and improved version](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/) of the Python bindings is under development.
The new bindings are installed through conda
```
conda install -c conda-forge igl
```

!!! warning
    The `master` branch of the `libigl` repository currently contains the **old** Python bindings.
    Those will be removed and replaced by these new bindings in the next version of libigl.
    Libigl v2.1.0 will be the last version to contain the old Python bindings.
    Users are encouraged to switch to our conda package to use the new bindings.
    It is a radical change which breaks compatibility between previous versions.
    We plan to stabilize the python bindings by the end of 2020.
